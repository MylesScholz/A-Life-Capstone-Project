# Cell Data Structure
Cell  
├─Cell State: a container for state variables of this cell divided by their associated organelle/component  
│ ├─Nucleus: the decision-making center of the cell; contains "administrative" variables  
│ │ ├─Alive: whether this cell is alive or not  
│ │ ├─Birth Time: the time when this cell was created  
│ │ ├─Lifespan: the duration after which this cell has a chance to die  
│ │ ├─Homeostasis Cost: the amount of nutrients expended per unit of time to keep this cell alive  
│ │ ├─Reproduction Cost: the amount of nutrients expended when this cell reproduces  
│ │ ├─Reproduction Threshold: the amount of nutrients needed for this cell to reproduce (> reproduction cost)  
│ │ └─...  
│ ├─Mitochondria: the primary energy producer of the cell; contains nutrient variables  
│ │ ├─Nutrients: the amount of nutrients stored in this cell currently  
│ │ ├─Nutrient Maximum: the maximum amount of nutrients this cell can store at one time  
│ │ ├─Nutrient Efficiency: the proportion of environmental nutrients this cell can gather per unit of time  
│ │ └─...  
│ ├─Flagella: an external cell component that enables motility; contains movement variables  
│ │ ├─Movement Force: a 2D force vector that this cell will apply to itself next  
│ │ └─...  
│ └─...  
├─Genome  
│ ├─Active Genes: this cell's genes that may activate after its creation  
│ │ ├─Gene: a node drawn from a universal pool representing a single feature or behavior of the cell  
│ │ │ ├─Activation Function: a function that runs regularly and implements the gene's behavior  
│ │ │ └─...  
│ │ └─...  
│ ├─Passive Genes: this cell's genes that only activate at creation  
│ │ ├─Gene: a node drawn from a universal pool representing a single feature or behavior of the cell  
│ │ │ ├─Activation Function: a function that runs at the cell's creation and implements the gene's behavior
